Nevertheless, we were able to identify some trends in the given dataset and following are the list of recommendations that could be applied to Bellabeat App Users:\n\n1. Majority of the users take 7638 steps a day, which falls into 'low active' category of lifestyle. Bellabeat could encourage their customers to reach a goal of 10,000 steps a day through push notifications.\n\n2. We discovered that people are the most active from 5PM to 7PM. We assume that this is a time when people come home from work, and go to gym. Based on this information, we would advise Bellabeat App to send a notification around this time to remind their users to get some physical exercise. \n\n3. We witnessed a clear relathionship between calories burned and active minutes. For those users, who are willing to lose weight Bellabeat App could promote fitness programs for their customers, and provide a platform where they could track their calories.\n\n4. The average number of daily sedentary minutes was about 909 minutes. This is relatively low active and could potentially impact sleep quality of the users. Therefore, Bellabeat could add regular reminders (vibrations) to their devices to encourage their users to move around or go for a run, and also add a tracking feauture for their sleep patterns. \n\n5. Since the target group of Bellabeat is women, expanding the tracking features for reproductive health  could be highly beneficial for the company, and would create a supportive platform to prioritize women's health. \n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}}]}
